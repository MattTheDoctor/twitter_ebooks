SETUP

run

in the directory where you have placed twert.py. This will create an empty brain.

Run

to read the contents of the supplied training file into cobe. This distribution of thom_ebooks comes with a limited set of CelestialBeard tweets. You can put whatever you like in a text file (maybe actual ebooks?), and pass it to the brain with the learn command.

Create a twitter account and use it to register an application on dev.twitter.com. Set access to read/write and generate an access token. Enter the necessary information into twert.py

Run twert.py to test your thom_ebooks. If the result is to your liking, you can schedule updates with cron.
